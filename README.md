## 🤖 My Machine Learning and Deep Learning Projects

Here you can find the links and brief descriptions of my Machine Learning and Deep Learning projects developed on Google Colab.

### 1. Project: ING HUB Datathon: Customer Churn Prediction (ANN + CatBoost)

Objective: Developed a high-performance predictive model to identify customers likely to churn by integrating and analyzing multi-source banking datasets.

Technical Highlights:


Data Integration: Engineered a unified pipeline to process monthly aggregated transaction histories (EFTs, Credit Card usage), demographic data, and time-series reference dates.


Hybrid Modeling: Implemented and compared Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and CatBoost algorithms to handle complex non-linear relationships and categorical features.


Feature Engineering: Focused on behavioral patterns and transaction trends to optimize model performance metrics like AUC.


Impact: Delivered a structured solution for proactive customer retention strategies, following competition standards.

  ### 4.Project Name: Voice Gender Prediction
**Description**Using the 26 features in the dataset, the project predicts whether a person's voice belongs to a male or a female. The following algorithms were used for this prediction: Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier. The model with the lowest cost and least complexity should be selected. You can access the models via the Colab links below.
