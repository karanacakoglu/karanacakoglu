## ðŸ¤– My Machine Learning Projects

Here you can find the links and brief descriptions of my Machine Learning and Deep Learning projects developed on Google Colab.

### 1. Project: ING HUB Datathon: Customer Churn Prediction (ANN + CatBoost)

**Description:** This project involves developing a model to predict whether a customer will churn on a given date, using the customers, customer_history, referance_date, referance_date_test, and sample_submission datasets. The model development initially used ANN and subsequently the CatBoost algorithms.

* **ðŸ“Š Dataset Note;**
* **customer_history.csv**: File containing customers' monthly aggregated transaction history **(EFTs, credit card spending, etc.)**
* **customers.csv**: File containing customers' demographic information **(age, gender, etc.)**.
* **reference_data.csv:** File indicating which customers are labeled as **"lost" (churn)** on which reference date, used for model training.
* **reference_data_test.csv**: File containing the **reference information** for test customers for whom churn prediction is requested.
* **sample_submission.csv**: Sample file showing the required **format** for submitting predictions to the competition.

### 2. Project Name: Telecom Customer Churn Prediction (Artificial Neural Network - ANN)

**Description:** In this project, the churn status is predicted using customer data found in the telekom_customer_churn.csv dataset. The model selected for prediction is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

* **ðŸ“Š Dataset Source:** [Telecom Customer Churn Prediction Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
* **ðŸ“Š Dataset Note:** The customer's churn status should be predicted using the data contained in the telekom_customer_churn.csv dataset.

### 3. Project Name: Credit Status Prediction

**Description:** Based on the data in the dataset, the model will predict whether a person will be granted a credit card. For model performance selection, the following models were tested: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Kernel SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, XGBoost, and LGBM.

* **ðŸ“Š Dataset Source:** [Loan Prediction Problem Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset)
* **Dataset Note:** This dataset was used to predict a customer's loan approval status based on their financial organization details (Income, Marital Status, Education, Credit History, etc.). Access to the data in the Colab notebooks was provided via the Kaggle API or manual upload.

  ### 4.Project Name: Voice Gender Prediction
**Description**Using the 26 features in the dataset, the project predicts whether a person's voice belongs to a male or a female. The following algorithms were used for this prediction: Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier. The model with the lowest cost and least complexity should be selected. You can access the models via the Colab links below.
