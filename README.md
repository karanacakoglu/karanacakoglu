## 🤖 My Machine Learning and Deep Learning Projects

Here you can find the links and brief descriptions of my Machine Learning and Deep Learning projects developed on Google Colab.

### 1. Project: ING HUB Datathon: Customer Churn Prediction (ANN + CatBoost)

Objective: Developed a high-performance predictive model to identify customers likely to churn by integrating and analyzing multi-source banking datasets.

Technical Highlights:


Data Integration: Engineered a unified pipeline to process monthly aggregated transaction histories (EFTs, Credit Card usage), demographic data, and time-series reference dates.


Hybrid Modeling: Implemented and compared Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and CatBoost algorithms to handle complex non-linear relationships and categorical features.


Feature Engineering: Focused on behavioral patterns and transaction trends to optimize model performance metrics like AUC.


Impact: Delivered a structured solution for proactive customer retention strategies, following competition standards.
